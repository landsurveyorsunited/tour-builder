Tour Builder lets you create simple embeddable "Tours" for the Google Earth API.  The simple mode lets you select a single location to fly to, while the advanced mode lets you create a series of locations that will automatically playback, with a simple embed.

See  http://tour-builder.appspot.com for a demonstration.
