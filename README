This is a basic demo of how you can create easily embeddable 'tours' for the
Earth API.  To run this on AppEngine, you will want to ensure you have the
following libraries included:
 - simplejson
 - django


 Also be sure to create a local_settings.py which includes, at least,
 ADMINS and GOOGLE_API_KEY
